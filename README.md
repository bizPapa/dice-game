## Description
The dice game is a 2 player game designed to demonstrate and showcase my Javascript, HTML and CSS skills.

The objective for the game is to reach a score of 100 by rolling dice and holding at the correct time. Each time a user rolls a 1 then the temporary score resets and the active player switches to the other. 

3 Buttons: New Game, Roll Dice and Hold

New Game: resets the whole game, returning it to the original state
Roll dice: creates digital roll producing a random number between 1 and 6.
Hold: allows the user to hold their score which in turn becomes their new highscore.

Each time a user rolls a 1 then the temporary score is returned to zero and the active player is switched.
